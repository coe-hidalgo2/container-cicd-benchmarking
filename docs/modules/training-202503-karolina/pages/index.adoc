== Welcome

Welcome to the training session on Containerization, CI/CD, and Benchmarking Solutions for HPC. 
This session marks the beginning of our three-day journey to equip you with practical tools and methodologies to optimize and manage high-performance computing environments. 
We are excited to have you here and look forward to engaging, interactive sessions that will build your skills and foster collaboration.

== Course Objectives

The primary objectives of this training session are to:

* **Containerize HPC Applications:** Learn how to build, manage, and optimize container images using Docker and Singularity/Apptainer.
* **Implement CI/CD Workflows:** Gain practical experience in automating builds, tests, and deployments with GitHub Actions, GitLab Runners, and JacamarCI.
* **Design Benchmarking Pipelines:** Understand how to set up and execute benchmarking pipelines using tools like feelpp.benchmarking and reframe-hpc.

These objectives are designed to ensure that you can apply the concepts learned directly to your HPC projects and research initiatives.

== Participant Introductions

We value the diversity of experience and expertise in this training. 
To kick off our session, we will have a round of introductions where each participant can share:

* **Name and Affiliation:** Tell us your name and the organization or institution you represent.
* **Background in HPC and CI/CD:** Briefly describe your experience with HPC environments, containerization, and CI/CD workflows.
* **Expectations:** What do you hope to gain from this training session? Feel free to share specific topics or skills you’re eager to explore.

This interactive segment is not only a way for us to get to know each other but also an opportunity to tailor discussions and exercises to better fit your backgrounds and expectations.

== Session Format and Logistics

Our session today will include:

- Brief lectures to introduce key concepts.
- Interactive discussions to engage and address your questions.
- Hands-on exercises to solidify the learning experience.

=== Tools & Technical Setup

For today’s exercises, we will be using **GitHub Codespaces** and **GitHub Classroom**:

* **GitHub Codespaces:**  
  - Provides a cloud-based development environment that ensures everyone has a consistent setup.
  - Make sure you have a GitHub account and that you have accepted the invitation to use Codespaces.
  - No local installation of development tools is necessary, though you may choose to use your local environment if preferred.

* **GitHub Classroom:**  
  - Used for distributing assignments and managing code repositories.
  - Ensure you have received the GitHub Classroom invitation and have access to the relevant repositories.
  - This platform will help you submit assignments and receive feedback seamlessly during the session.

* **HPC systems:**
    - We will also be working with HPC systems for building and deploying containers and benchmarking exercises.
